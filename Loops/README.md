A **loop** is used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a condition becomes false.

Loops help reduce repetition and make code more efficient.

## Types of Loops

### 1. For Loop
- Used when you know how many times you want to execute a statement.
- It is commonly used with counters.
- Best choice when the number of iterations is known.

---

### 2. While Loop
- Used when you do not know exactly how many times the loop will run.
- The loop continues as long as the condition is true.
- The condition is checked before each iteration.

### 3. Do While Loop
- Runs at least once, even if the condition is false.
- The condition is checked after the loop executes.
- Guarantees at least one execution.
