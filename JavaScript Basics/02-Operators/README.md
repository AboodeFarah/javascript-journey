# JavaScript Operators

**Operators** are symbols used to perform operations on values and variables.

## Arithmetic Operators

These operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

- **Addition (`+`)** – adds two values  
- **Subtraction (`-`)** – subtracts one value from another  
- **Multiplication (`*`)** – multiplies two values  
- **Division (`/`)** – divides one value by another  
- **Modulus (`%`)** – returns the remainder  
- **Increment (`++`)** – increases a value by 1 
- **Decrement (`--`)** – decreases a value by 1

## Increment Types

There are two types of increment:

### 1. Post-Increment (`value++`)
- The old value is used first, then it is increased by 1.  

### 2. Pre-Increment (`++value`)
- The value is increased first, then used in the operation.
