# JavaScript Operators

**Operators** are symbols used to perform operations on values and variables.

---

## Arithmetic Operators

These operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

- **Addition (`+`)** – adds two values  
- **Subtraction (`-`)** – subtracts one value from another  
- **Multiplication (`*`)** – multiplies two values  
- **Division (`/`)** – divides one value by another  
- **Modulus (`%`)** – returns the remainder  
- **Increment (`++`)** – increases a value by 1.
- **Decrement (`--`)** – decreases a value by 1

## Increment Types

There are two types of increment:

### 1. Post-Increment (`value++`)
- The old value is used first, then it is increased by 1.  

### 2. Pre-Increment (`++value`)
- The value is increased first, then used in the operation.

## Comparison Operators

These operators are used to compare two values.

- **Equal to (`==`)**  
  Checks if two values are equal.

- **Not equal to (`!=`)**  
  Checks if two values are not equal.

- **Strictly equal to (`===`)**  
  Checks if two values are equal and of the same type.

- **Strictly not equal to (`!==`)**  
  Checks if two values are not equal and not of the same type.

- **Greater than (`>`)**  
  Checks if one value is greater than another.

- **Less than (`<`)**  
  Checks if one value is less than another.

- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**  
  Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.

- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**  
  Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.

---

## Logical Operators

These operators are used to combine or invert boolean values.

- **AND (`&&`)**  
  Returns true if both operands are true.

- **OR (`||`)**  
  Returns true if at least one operand is true.

- **NOT (`!`)**  
  Inverts the boolean value (changes true to false, and false to true).

---

## String Operators

These operators are used to concatenate (combine) strings.

- **Concatenation (`+`)**  
  Combines two or more strings into one single string.

- **Concatenation Assignment (`+=`)**  
  Adds a string to an existing string variable and assigns the result back to the same variable.

---

## Why String Operators Are Important

String operators are useful for:

- Combining text values  
- Creating dynamic messages  
- Displaying user information
