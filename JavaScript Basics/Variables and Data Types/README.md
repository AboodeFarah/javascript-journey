# What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript (JS)** is a programming language mainly used to make websites interactive.  
Think of it as the “action” behind a webpage:

- **HTML** → Creates the structure of a page (like the bones of a body).  
- **CSS** → Styles it (like skin, colors, clothes).  
- **JavaScript** → Makes it move or respond (like muscles and reactions).

## What is JavaScript Used For?

### 1. Client-Side Development
- Change content on a page without reloading (e.g., live search bars).  
- Respond to user actions (clicks, mouse movement, typing).  

### 2. Mobile Apps
- Using tools like **React Native**, JS can build apps for iPhone and Android.

### 3. Server-Side Development
- With **Node.js**, JavaScript can run on a server, handle databases, and manage websites behind the scenes.

### 4. Games
- Browser-based games use JS to handle animations, player moves, scores, and more.

### 5. Internet of Things (IoT)
- **Controlling Devices:** JavaScript can interact with hardware through frameworks like **Johnny-Five**.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Home Automation: Controlling lights, thermostats, and other devices.

## What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a container used to store data values.  
It allows us to store information and reuse it later in the program.

## Declaring Variables

JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:

### 1. `var`
- The oldest way to declare a variable.
- It has **function scope**.
- Not recommended in modern JavaScript.

### 2. `let`
- Used when the value of a variable may change.
- It has **block scope**.
- Recommended in most cases.

### 3. `const`
- Used for variables that should not change after being assigned.
- It also has **block scope**.
- Recommended when the value should stay constant.
