# What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript (JS)** is a programming language mainly used to make websites interactive.  
Think of it as the “action” behind a webpage:

- **HTML** → Creates the structure of a page (like the bones of a body).  
- **CSS** → Styles it (like skin, colors, clothes).  
- **JavaScript** → Makes it move or respond (like muscles and reactions).
