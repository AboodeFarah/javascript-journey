## What is an Array?

An **array** is a data structure that can store multiple values inside a single variable name.

Instead of creating many separate variables, you can store related values together inside one array.

## Array Index

An **index** is the position number of an element inside an array.

- Array index starts from **zero (0)**.
- The first element is at index 0.
- The second element is at index 1.
- The third element is at index 2.
- And so on.

Understanding index is important because it allows you to access specific elements inside the array.

## Common Array Methods

### 1. `push`
- Adds an element to the end of an array.

### 2. `pop`
- Removes the last element of an array.

### 3. `shift`
- Removes the first element of an array.

### 4. `unshift`
- Adds an element to the beginning of an array.

### 5. `length`
- Returns the number of elements in an array.

Arrays are one of the most important data structures in JavaScript.

## What is an Object?

An **object** is a data structure used to store a collection of related data and functionality as key-value pairs.

- A **key** is the name of the property.
- A **value** is the data assigned to that key.
- Objects help organize related information together.

## Adding and Modifying Properties

Objects are flexible. You can:

- Add new properties after the object is created.
- Modify (change) the value of existing properties.
