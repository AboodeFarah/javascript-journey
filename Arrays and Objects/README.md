## What is an Array?

An **array** is a data structure that can store multiple values inside a single variable name.

Instead of creating many separate variables, you can store related values together inside one array.

## Array Index

An **index** is the position number of an element inside an array.

- Array index starts from **zero (0)**.
- The first element is at index 0.
- The second element is at index 1.
- The third element is at index 2.
- And so on.
